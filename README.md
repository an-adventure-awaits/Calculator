This is a calculator GUI project. 
I am going to practice and learn how to create GUI in a more advanced format.

Step 1:
  * I am going to sudo code it to play out how and where I want things.
  * Whild doing that I am going to draw onto a piece of paper to see what my vision is.

Step 2: 
  * Actually coding the project.
